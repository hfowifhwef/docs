<p>4. Please the blue “here” button and save this file safe.</p>
<p>5. <strong>ALSO SAVE YOUR EXPORT ID, THIS IS VITAL!</strong></p>
<p>6. At any-time, you can drag and drop your text file into a discord server with the message <code>m#import [export id]</code>with the attachment (obviously a guild with MessageBackupBot in it) and you will then have your content uploaded too our servers.</p>
<h1>How do I keep track of my backups getting deleted?</h1>
<p>Join our support guild <a href="https://invite.gg/snaildos">snaildos here</a> and you will get mentioned on updates about your backup</p>
<h1>Help! I got banned off discord!</h1>
<p>I am sorry, no matter what rank or how close you are to the community, we, <strong>cannot.</strong> Let me repeat that, we <i><strong>CANNOT</strong></i><strong> ever restore your backup to your account, it's gone forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You also CANNOT IMPORT a exported backup into another account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a discord limitation, ignoring this will get us BANNED.</strong></p>
<h1>I have a enormous server and want a custom amount of messages saved.</h1>
<p>Please, join our support guild and dm the modmail.</p>
