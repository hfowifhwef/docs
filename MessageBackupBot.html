<h1>Introduction to MessageBackupBot</h1>
<p>The MessageBackupBot, is the all new discord bot, allowing guild messages to be backed up, and restored. In this documentary, it shows you on how to set it up, and how to use it.</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To start using the bot, you need to invite it, by clicking <a href="https://messagebackup.snaildos.com">here.</a></p>
<p>Then, you want to select the “invite” link, and press “Invite To Your Server”. Please make sure you give it administrator or at least:</p>
<ul>

<p>4. Please press the blue “here” button and save this file somewhere safe.</p>
<p>5. <strong>ALSO SAVE YOUR EXPORT ID, THIS IS VITAL!</strong></p>
<p>6. At anytime, you can drag and drop your text file into a discord server with the message <code>m#import [export id]</code>with the attachment (obviously a guild with MessageBackupBot in it) and you will then have your content uploaded to our servers.</p>
<h1>How do I keep track of my backups getting deleted?</h1>
<p>Join our support guild <a href="https://invite.gg/snaildos">snaildos here</a> and you will get mentioned on updates about your backups</p>
<h1>Help! I got banned from discord!</h1>
<p>I am sorry, no matter what rank or how close you are to the community, we <strong>cannot.</strong> Let me repeat that, we <i><strong>CANNOT</strong></i><strong> ever restore your backup to your account, it's gone forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You also CANNOT IMPORT a exported backup into another account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a discord limitation, ignoring this will get us BANNED.</strong></p>
<h1>I have an enormous server and want a custom amount of messages saved.</h1>
<p>Please, join our support guild and DM the modmail.</p>
