<h1>How to install a bot on this service?</h1>

  <figcaption>Follow the instructions below</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
  <li>You should be familiar with Git, if not, you will have a hard time.</li>
  <li>On your git repo adress, type in your GitHub URL, install branch can should always be master. Leave User uploaded files and Auo Update to default. On your Git USERNAME, type your username</li>
  <li>For the service to function properly, type your github acess token. For github: https://github.com/settings/tokens type that URL, press “generate” and then copy and paste it in. No documentary exists for GitLab.</li>
  <li>After that, return to console and hit “start”. In a matter of minutes, your bot will start. Give your bot about 10-20 mins to load up for the first time.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Trouble-shooting</h1>
<p>As a support technician in SnailDOS, I see many people stuff these things up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invalid Bot Token</li>
  <li>The GitHub username, repo, or token is invalid, therefor, nothing is being cloned.</li>
  <li>People have no idea how basic linux works, and get confused.</li>
  <li>People who don't read the docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you a idea on what I don't want to see. Anyone who wastes my time, will, get a ban form our services.</p>
