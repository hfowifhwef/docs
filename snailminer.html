<p>We support GPU &amp; CPU mining, although note that you can only use one at a time.</p>
<p>With our mining app, you can earn up to 3.5 SnailCoins every 15 minutes!</p>
<p>SnailMiner allows you to mine Monero and in return receive a SnailCoin depending on your hashrate. You get rewarded every 15 minutes and the data gets saved on our servers.</p>
